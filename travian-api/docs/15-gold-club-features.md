# Gold Club Features & API Enforcement

Gold Club costs 200 Gold (one-time per game round) and unlocks premium features. This document maps each feature to its API enforcement status.

**Key finding: The Gold Club lock is inconsistent.** Some features are only locked in the UI (cosmetic), while others have server-side enforcement. The pattern is: **read/manage operations tend to work, but action/execution operations are blocked.**

## Feature Enforcement Matrix

| Feature | UI Locked | API CRUD | API Execute | Enforcement |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|-------------|
| **Farm Lists** | ✅ | ✅ Works | ❌ Send blocked | Server blocks `farm-list/send` only |
| **Trade Routes** | ✅ | ❓ Untested | ❓ Untested | Needs Gold Club to verify |
| **Archive (Reports/Messages)** | ✅ | ❓ Untested | ❓ Untested | Needs Gold Club to verify |
| **Map Crop Finder** | ✅ | ❓ Untested | ❓ Untested | Needs Gold Club to verify |
| **Troop Evasion** | ✅ | ❓ Untested | ❓ Untested | Needs Gold Club to verify |
| **3x Merchant Trips** | ✅ | N/A | N/A | Likely server-enforced (game mechanic) |

## Farm Lists (Verified)

**Gold Club cost:** 200 Gold (included in Gold Club)
**What it provides:** Manage raid target lists, send bulk raids from Rally Point

### API Enforcement Detail

| Operation | Endpoint | Method | Without Gold Club |
|-----------|----------|--------|:-:|
| Create list | `POST /api/v1/farm-list` | POST | ✅ Works |
| Update list | `PUT /api/v1/farm-list/{id}` | PUT | ✅ Works |
| Delete list | `DELETE /api/v1/farm-list/{id}` | DELETE | ✅ Works |
| Add slot | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/slot` | POST | ✅ Works |
| Update slot | `PUT /api/v1/farm-list/slot` | PUT | ✅ Works |
| Force add slot | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/slot?force` | POST | ✅ Works |
| Delete slot | `DELETE /api/v1/farm-list/slot` | DELETE | ✅ Works |
| Query (GQL) | `farmList(id:$id){...}` | GQL | ✅ Works |
| List all (GQL) | `ownPlayer{farmLists{...}}` | GQL | ✅ Works |
| Change expanded | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/change-expanded-state` | POST | ✅ Works |
| Change sorting | `PUT /api/v1/farm-list/{id}/change-sorting` | PUT | ✅ Works |
| Change sort index | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/{id}/change-sort-index` | POST | ✅ Works |
| Close inbox | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/close-inbox` | POST | ✅ Works |
| **Send raids** | `POST /api/v1/farm-list/send` | POST | ❌ `plus.error_goldclub` |

**Error response when blocked:**
```json
{
    "error": "plus.error_goldclub",
    "errorId": "haDh214Ufu64XWZV",
    "message": "Your Gold club is not activated."
}
```

### Practical Implication

You can programmatically:
1. Create farm lists with target analysis results
2. Add targets with calculated troop counts
3. Query all farm list data (including last raid results, booty totals)
4. Manage and organize targets

But to **actually send** the raids, you need either:
- Gold Club activated (200 Gold) → use `farm-list/send`
- No Gold Club → use the two-step form POST (documented in `13-troop-sending.md`)

> See `14-farm-list-api.md` for complete API documentation with verified request/response bodies.

## Trade Routes

**Gold Club cost:** Included in Gold Club
**What it provides:** Automatic scheduled resource deliveries between own villages

### Known Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `POST /api/v1/trade-routes` | POST | CRUD for trade routes |
| `POST /api/v1/trade-routes/toggle-group` | POST | Enable/disable a trade route group |

### UI Access

Trade routes are managed from the Marketplace building (`/build.php?gid=17`).

### API Enforcement

Without Gold Club, `POST /api/v1/trade-routes` returns `api.unexpectedError` — unclear if this is a Gold Club lock or a parameter issue. Further testing needed with Gold Club active.

---

## Archive (Reports & Messages)

**Gold Club cost:** Included in Gold Club
**What it provides:** Archive reports and messages for permanent storage

### UI Access

The "Archive" tab appears in both Reports (`/report`) and Messages (`/messages`) pages. Without Gold Club, clicking it shows a Gold Club purchase prompt.

### Known Behavior

The archive tab in reports has `goldclubDialog` configuration in its button data, suggesting UI-only lock for viewing. The actual archive/unarchive API endpoints are not yet verified.

---

## Map Crop Finder

**Gold Club cost:** Included in Gold Club
**What it provides:** Search for villages/tiles with high crop field counts on the map

### UI Access

Available as an overlay on the map page (`/karte.php`).

### Potential API

The crop finder likely uses the existing map API endpoints (`/api/v1/map/position`, `/api/v1/map/info`) with additional filtering parameters. The data for crop field distribution is already available in tile data (field type templates like `{k.f3}`, `{k.f4}`, etc.), so a crop finder could be built programmatically using existing documented endpoints without Gold Club.

---

## Troop Evasion

**Gold Club cost:** Included in Gold Club
**What it provides:** Automatically send troops away from capital before incoming attacks

### UI Access

Configured in village settings or Rally Point.

### Notes

This is likely a server-side automation feature — the server detects incoming attacks and automatically dispatches a pre-configured evasion. Unclear if any API endpoints exist beyond configuration.

---

## 3x Merchant Trips

**Gold Club cost:** Included in Gold Club
**What it provides:** Each merchant completes up to 3 trips per trade order

### Notes

This is a pure game mechanic change (server-side multiplier). No separate API endpoint — it modifies the behavior of existing marketplace trade requests. Without Gold Club, each merchant makes 1 trip.

## Gold Club Status Check

### GraphQL

```graphql
{
    ownPlayer {
        goldFeatures {
            goldClub
            travianPlus { isActive }
        }
    }
}
```

**Response (not activated):**
```json
{
    "data": {
        "ownPlayer": {
            "goldFeatures": {
                "goldClub": false,
                "travianPlus": {
                    "isActive": false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Error Pattern

When a Gold Club feature is server-enforced, the error follows this pattern:
```json
{
    "error": "plus.error_goldclub",
    "errorId": "{randomId}",
    "message": "Your Gold club is not activated."
}
```

### UI Lock Pattern

In the page HTML, Gold Club-locked tabs use a `goldclubDialog` configuration:
```json
{
    "featureKey": "raidList|messageArchive|...",
    "infoIcon": "https://support.travian.com/.../gold-club",
    "cssClass": "premiumFeaturePackage premiumFeatureGoldclub paymentShopV4",
    "premiumFeatureDialogVersion": 2,
    "version": 2,
    "paymentShopVersion": 4
}
```

This triggers a purchase dialog instead of navigating to the feature page. The API endpoints behind these pages may still be accessible directly.
